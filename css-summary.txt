- CSS associates rules with HTML elements & contains 2 parts
	1. selector
	2. declaration
	Example:	p {
					font-family: Arial;}
	p is the selector
	what's inside the braces {} is the declaration
- Selector
	Indicates what element the rule applies to
	The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas
- Declarations
	Indicate how the elements (referred to in the selector) should be styled
	Split into two parts- a property and a value, and are separated by ';'
- Property
	Indicate the aspects of the element you want to change
- Values
	Specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties

	Example:	h1, h2, h3 {
							font-family: Arial;
							color: yellow;}
- Linking
	Used to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. Is a empty element, and lives inside the head element. Following are attributes & an example:
	- rel
		Specifies the relationship between the html page and the file it's linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.
	- type
		Specifies the type of document being linked to. For CSS, should be text/css.
	- href
		Specifies the path for the css FILE
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/styles.css" />
- Internal CSS
	In the HTML, you can use the <style> tag for internal html. However, your CSS should be in an external file.
