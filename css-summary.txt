- CSS associates rules with HTML elements & contains 2 parts
	1. selector
	2. declaration
	Example:	p {
					font-family: Arial;}
	p is the selector
	what's inside the braces {} is the declaration
- Selector
	Indicates what element the rule applies to
	The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas
- Declarations
	Indicate how the elements (referred to in the selector) should be styled
	Split into two parts- a property and a value, and are separated by ';'
- Property
	Indicate the aspects of the element you want to change
- Values
	Specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties

	Example:	h1, h2, h3 {
							font-family: Arial;
							color: yellow;}
