<blockquote> </blockquote>
					Used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. You can use <p> tags within.
<q> </q>			Used for shorter quotes that are within a paragraph. But, IE doesn't put " " quotes around the quote,
					even though other browsers do. So people avoid this tag.
<abbr> </abbr>		If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, you can use the <abbr> element. The title tag is used to specify the full term.
					HTML5 just uses the <abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms, while in HTML4
					there was a separate <acronym> element.
<cite> </cite>		The cite element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
					In HTML5 <cite> shouldn't be used for a person's name (though people did in HTML4).
					Browsers will render content of <cite> in italics.
<dfn> </dfn>		Is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. Some browsers show the content in italics.
					The word/phrase that needs to be defined goes within the tags, and the definition after.
<address> </address>
					The <address> element has a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
					It can contain the physical address but doesn't have to. Could contain phone # or email address.
					Also, see hCard microformat for adding physical address info.
<ins> </ins>		Used to show content that has been inserted into a document. (text is usually underlined)
<del> </del>		Can show text that has been deleted from a document. (text has a line through it)

					Note: older versions of HTML had the <u> element for underlined content, but this is being phased out.
<a> </a>			The link tag, to connect webpages. Most commonly used with this is the href attribute. (see below)

- Attributes -

- lang
	<p lang="en">Paragraph in English</p>
	The lang attribute. Indicates the text within is in the language specified.
- cite
	<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh"> </blockquote>
	In the above example, cite is the attribute. The value should be a URL that contains more data about the citation.
- href
	<a href="mailto:homer@example.org">homer@example.org</a>
	<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>
	The href attribute, within the <a></a> tags. href indicates a link's destination.
- target
	There's also the target="_blank" attribute, which opens a link in a new window.
	Generally, you should avoid opening links in a new window, but if you do, it's considered good 
	practice to inform users that the link will open a new window before they click on it.
- id
	The id attribute assignes an id to an html element.
	In chapter 4, we use href's to link to certain id's as a way to go to certain locations on the page.
	Example:
				<a href="#topOfPage">Go To Top</a>		Clicking this will go to the html element that has
														the id = "topOfPage"
				<h2 id="topOfPage">Welcome!</h2>		This is the h2 element that is id'd by topOfPage.
														When the link above is clicked, the page will go to
														where this html element is!
- src
	In this example, used for images. Tells the <img /> tag where the image is.
- alt
	In the <img /> tag, this is a text description of the image in case the image doesn't come up,
	and also is helpful for those with screen reader software and search engines.
	If using an image to only make a page look more attractive, then include this, but the quotes
	should be empty.
- title
	Can use with the <img /> element to provide additional info about the image. Any text that is within
	the quotes for this attribute will appear in a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the image.
- height
	Specifies the height of an image in pixels. (More people are starting to use CSS for image sizing instead of HTML)
- width
	Specifies the width of an image in pixels. (More people are starting to use CSS for image sizing instead of HTML)
