# HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites
### My source code & notes for the book.

I've done HTML & CSS before, but decided to quickly go through this book that I already had as a refresher. My code isn't exactly like the book, but extremely close. An example of difference is that instead of typing out a bunch of stuff in paragraph tags, I threw in some [bacon ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/).

There's also the file [summary.txt](https://github.com/coltonhurst/book-html-css/blob/master/summary.txt), which is essentially a cheat sheet and note page for the book that I created as I went through for future reference.

### Note:

In no way do I take any ownership of the code that Jon Duckett (the author) created. He has some code samples online [here](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/). Note that some code has come from his website (incomplete code within the book that is on the website). Please see the [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/coltonhurst/book-html-css/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) file for more information.

#### Final note

I didn't go through the complete book. The original reason for going through the book was as a refresher (not my first time doing html/css). However, while the reviewing was helpful, it was eventually becoming slow & repetitive. Long story short, I'm not planning on finishing this. Moved on to cooler stuff. Way cooler stuff. I wish I could put it all up on github, but... not allowed. :/
